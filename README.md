# Notable projects
## Computer Vision
- [camera_calibration](https://github.com/anstadnik/camera_calibration) - Improve camera calibration for cameras with wide FOV by
simulating the distorted lattice and predicting possible locations of the
previously undetected points. My Master's diploma project.

## ML
- [adversarial_attack](https://github.com/anstadnik/adversarial_attack) - Generate adversarial noise using genetic algorithms to hide the text from an OCR toolchain (Tesseract) such that a human can still read it.
- [smart_rockets](https://github.com/anstadnik/smart_rockets) - pathfinding in a labyrinth using genetic algorithms.

## Rust
- [FirstAidBot](https://github.com/anstadnik/FirstAidBot/) - a telegram bot and an MVP app for helping civilians delivering first aid. Rust, Flutter, CI/CD, auto-deploy to cloud.
- [replicated_log](https://github.com/anstadnik/replicated_log) - a web server, which broadcasts messages to clients. Supports quorum, health checks, message resending etc.
- [rust_algs](https://github.com/anstadnik/rust_algs) - implementation of disjoint set, segment_tree, trie, list_node and tree_node (from leetcode).

## C++
- [goto-elimination](https://github.com/anstadnik/goto-elimination) - An implementation of [Taming Control Flow A Structured Approach to Eliminating Goto Statements](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2609386_Taming_Control_Flow_A_Structured_Approach_to_Eliminating_Goto_Statements).
- [RGOL](https://github.com/anstadnik/RGOL) - reverse game of life using genetic algorithms.
- [cpp-algs](https://github.com/anstadnik/cpp_algs) - collection of useful C++
stuff, used mainly for competitive programming.

## C
- [brainfuck](https://github.com/anstadnik/brainfuck) - An implementation of the brainfuch interpreter and debugger.
- [libft](https://github.com/anstadnik/libft) - my implementation of the C standard library, including printf.
- [minitalk](https://github.com/anstadnik/minitalk) - send strings using user signals

  - **linear_algebra**: Various projects (both python and math in latex) on topics including orthogonality, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, matrix factorization and iterations and numerical optimization.
  - **statistics**: Just a lot of math.
  - **warehousing**: Data varehousing. ETL in sql.
- sem_2
  - **bayesian_methods**: Statistics, Kalman filter, particle filter.
  - **DL**: Implementation of simple CNN in latex and python by hand, in scalar and matrix forms. Both training and inference.
  - **ML**: Basically, a lot of ML algs, including SVM, decision trees, random forests, boosting, clustering, PCA, t-SNE, etc.
  - **perf**: Cuda, speeding python up with mutltithreading Rust, SIMD in Rust etc.
  - **vis**: Texty.org-like visualizations using Altair.
- sem_3
  - **academic_writing**: Writing a paper on the topic of the course.
  - **[camera_calibration](https://github.com/anstadnik/camera_calibration)**: My thesis project.
  - **CV**: Computer vision course. All kinds of stuff, including classical, deep learning. Segmentation, detection, tracking, etc.
  - **health**: A project with Toronto University.
  - **MMDS**: Mining massive datasets. Spark, Streams, BloomFilter, etc.
